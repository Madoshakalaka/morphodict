### types

Npm package `@altlab/types` with typescript that serve as our API schema. 

Note this package is separate from the "package" under the project root level, 
the latter being javascript dependencies of our project.

The typescript file is generated from python TypedDict's under `CreeDictionary/API/schema.py`
