# Style Guide

This style guide documents the lexicographical conventions used in the ALT Lab Plains Cree dictionary database.

## Database Fields

Most types of information in the database fit nicely within the [DLx DaFoDiL specification][DaFoDiL]. The following are potential exceptions / additions:

* `comparisons`: Manual comparisons of the entries in CW and MD.

* `fstStem`: The stem used by the FST, when it is different from the stem in the entry.

* `headword`
  - The headword is always the citation form of the word, not necessarily the stem.
  - Homographs are not distinguished with a homograph number.

## Citation Forms

- **verb:** <small>3SG.INDEP</small>
- **noun (dependent):** <small>1SG.POSS</small>
- **noun (independent):** <small>SG</small> (non-possessed)
- **noun (plural-only):** <small>PL</small> (non-possessed)
- probably othersâ€¦
