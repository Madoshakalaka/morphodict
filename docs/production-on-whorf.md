Production deployment on Whorf
------------------------------

Updated: <time datetime="2021-04-16">April 16, 2021</time>.

itwÃªwina is deployed on ALTLab's "Whorf Cluster"; specifically, a host
called `itw.altlab.dev`. Its web address is:

<https://itwewina.altlab.app>

## Where is everything?

All paths are on `itw.altlab.dev`, unless otherwise specified:

### The `itwewina` user's home directory

   `/opt/docker-compose/itwewina`

### The cloned repository

`/opt/docker-compose/itwewina/cree-intelligent-dictionary`

### The database

Please refer to the `volumes` key in the [`docker-compose.yml`][docker-compose] file

### The Docker image

The [GitHub container registry][ghcr].


## Important files to check for deployment

These are the files I am most-often modifying when mucking about with the deployment:

 - `docker/docker-compose.yml`
 - `docker/Dockerfile`
 - `docker/deploy`
 - `CreeDictionary/uwsgi.ini`

## Redeployment

Every time a commit is pushed to the default branch on GitHub, the
redeployment workflow begins on GitHub actions:

 - the unit tests and integration tests run
 - a Docker image is built
 - the Docker image is built and pushed to the [GitHub container
   registry][ghcr]

When the tests pass, <https://deploy.altlab.dev/>, which then instructs
the Whorf cluster to pull the latest changes **both** from the git
repository **and** from the uploaded Docker image. The new Docker image
is run on `itw.altlab.dev`.

Migrations are run, and (in most cases), the new code is deployed!
