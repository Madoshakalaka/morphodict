# Glossary

This is a glossary of terminology as used in the intelligent dictionary app.

- **This is not a glossary of linguistic terminology.** The definitions of terms in linguistics often vary from subfield to subfield, or depending on context. For the intelligent dictionary app, we need single, unambiguous definitions. Therefore this glossary focuses on how terms are operationalized and used in the intelligent dictionary app. The way terms are used in this app sometimes differ from how the terms are used in linguistics; these differences are noted where relevant. Some linguistics terms are included for informational purposes even though the term might not be used in the app code.

- **This document is intended to be _normative_.** The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC-2119]. Code used by the app SHOULD align to the uses defined here.

<dl>

  <dt id=citation-form>citation form</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The form of the word used when the word is spoken in isolation. It's typically the form that a speaker gives when you ask, <q>How do you translate X?</q> or <q>What does X mean?</q>. Sometimes this varies: an English speaker might say <i>eat</i> or <i>to eat</i>. The citation form is not necessarily the same as the <a href=#head>head</a>, <a href=#lemma>lemma</a>, <a href=#minimal-word>minimal word</a>, or <a href=#stem>stem</a>, although it can be the same as any of these.<p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>English example</b>: The citation form for verbs in English is usually the infinitive. <i>to be</i> is the citation form of the verb <i>be</i>.</li>
      <li><b>Plains Cree example:</b> The citation form for verbs is the third person singular independent (<small>3SG.INDEP</small>) form. <i>mîciw</i> is the citation form of the verb <i>mîci‑</i> <q>eat</q>.</li>
    </ul>
