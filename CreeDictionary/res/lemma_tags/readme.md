Files here store templates of common lemma fst tags for each inflectional category  

i.e. 
- NA lemmas usually has tags +N+A+Sg
- VAI lemmas usually has tags +V+AI+Ind+Prs+3Sg
- ...

When two analyses have the same form and inflection categories, this extra information helps choose the preferred lemma

i.e. It helps solve this question: "Which one of maskwa+N+A+Sg and maskwa+N+A+Obv is the lemma?"

Folders here are languages this app supports.

There should be a `lemma-tags.tsv` Under each folder with two columns.

The first column is the [general word class](../../../docs/glossary.md#general-word-class) with
