# 2019/May/21 Matt Yan:

# The reason to have different rules in development/production:

# static file urls / web-page urls / API urls in this project all begin with "cree-dictionary"
# so that in production on server sapir, the cree-dictionary service can be proxy-ed by looking for
# initial "cree-dictionary" in the url.

# example url:
# http://sapir.artsrn.ualberta.ca/cree-dictionary/search/hello

# in development, though, the initial "cree-dictionary" is not needed, example:
# http://localhost:8000/search/hello
# Note: re_path here, for example "re_path("^(cree-dictionary/)?some/url")", isn't a good solution. It messes up with
# url reversion

# 2021-01-12 Eddie Antonio Santos:
#
# I'm in the process of fixing this on Sapir.
#
# This routing code needs to know how to handle both when SCRIPT_NAME is
# specified as '/cree-dictionary' and when it's not.
#
# Then, the Gunicorn config on Sapir must be changed to supply -v
# SCRIPT_NAME='/cree-dictionary' in its startup options.
#
# The following function, as well as any comments ands hacks associated with it can be
# deleted soon!


def running_on_sapir_without_script_name():  # pragma: no cover
    """
    The WSGI SCRIPT_NAME environment variable indicates the part of the URL's path before the
    first slash handled within this application.

    Usually, SCRIPT_NAME is the empty string. On Sapir, it SHOULD be "/cree-dictionary":

                                           SCRIPT_NAME
                                        ,--------------.
                                        v              v
        https://sapir.artsrn.ualberta.ca/cree-dictionary/

    However, we have not configured it this way :/

    This function enables a hack when we're running on sapir, but the script name is not
    set.

    See: https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/faq.html#how-do-i-set-script-name
    See: https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/definitions.html#envvar-SCRIPT_NAME
