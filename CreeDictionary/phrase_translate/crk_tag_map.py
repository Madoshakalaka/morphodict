from phrase_translate.tag_map import TagMap

# A TagMap is iniialized with a sequence of (wordform_tag, phrase_tag,
# precedence) tuples
#
# wordform_tag can be:
#   - A literal tag, e.g., "N+", which will be matched exactly
#   - A tuple of tags, e.g., ("PV/e+, "+Ind") which will be matched as a
#     subsequence
#
# phrase_tag can be:
#   - None if the wordform_tag is not used in the phrase transcription
#   - "copy" if the characters of the wordform_tag match the phrase_tag, for
#     example: ("+Sg", "copy", x) means ("+Sg", "Sg+", x)
#
# The precedence number is used to sort tags before sending to the phrase FST,
# so if you want Pl/Sg before Px, you could give Pl and Sg number 1 and the
# possessives number 2. This precedence number is associated with the output
# tag; it is an error to give a different precedence value to multiple
# definitions that output the same tag.
