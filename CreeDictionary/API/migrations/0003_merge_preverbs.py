# Created by Matt

# The database had two forms of preverbs existing, one with dash, one without
# e.g. "e" and "ê-" coexist in the database,
# "e" has definition from MD and "ê-" has definition from CW. They should be merged
# e.g. "mayi" from MD and "mâyi-" from CW coexist in the database
# preverbs in MD typically does not have circumflexes and do not have dashes

# this migration merges these preverbs and standardize both "full-lc" and "pos" to IPV
# this migration is conservative and tries to not err by merging when very sure.

# this migration also appends dashes to all preverbs when absent
