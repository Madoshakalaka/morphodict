"""
SQLite `INSERT â€¦ RETURNING` support.

This lets you call `bulk_create` and immediately get back the IDs auto-assigned
by the database, instead of having to assign them manually, or issue additional
queries to try to find the new IDs for the objects you just saved.

Backport of a feature which should be released as part of Django 4.0. See:
https://github.com/django/django/commit/98abc0c90e0eb7fe3a71cfa360962cf59605f1d3

In `settings.py`, set this module as the `ENGINE` in `DATBASES`.

Requires SQLite >= 3.35; sadly, that is not currently available in any of the
https://hub.docker.com/_/python/ images, but will be in ubuntu:21.10 shortly.
