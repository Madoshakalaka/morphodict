# Base docker-compose for itwewina.
#
# NOTE!!!!!!!!!
# This docker-compose file is useless standalone. You **MUST** combine it with
# either ./production.yml or ./development.yml.
#
# Why? Because docker-compose merges the `ports` setting in a sad way :(
#
# To use in production, use the following:
#
#     docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f production.yml
#
# To use in development, use the following:
#
#     docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f development.yml
#
# See: https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files
